Simulation of the spectrum of dipole-dipole interaction between a high-spin Fe(III) and a nitroxide
=========

Description
=========
This script calculates four lowest energy levels of the spin system high-spin Fe(III) / nitroxide and derives the of the spectrum of dipole-dipole interaction between both spin centers.
